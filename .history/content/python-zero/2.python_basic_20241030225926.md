As we mentioned earlier, Python is excellent for data processing, so we'll provide an overview of Python's built-in data structures and libraries from a data manipulation perspective. But as the saying goes, "sharpening your axe won't delay your woodcutting," so before we start learning, we must have a good "tool" at hand. It's highly recommended that everyone install Anaconda. You can install it from the following link [Anaconda China Mirror](https://mirror.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/anaconda/)

And it's highly recommended that everyone manually types the code in IPython or Jupyter during the exploration learning process, and follows the examples to experiment and try different things.

## 2.1 Running the First Command

Python is an interpreted language. The Python interpreter runs a program by executing each line of the program. The standard interactive Python interpreter can be invoked using the `python` command in the terminal:

```
$ python
Python 3.10.4 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Mar 24 2022, 17:38:57)
[GCC 10.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = 5
>>> print(a)
5

```

You see the `>>>` is the _prompt_ where you will input the code expression. To exit the Python interpreter, you can input `exit()` or press Ctrl-D (only for Linux and macOS).

Running a Python program is as simple as calling `python` and passing the _.py_ file as the first argument. Suppose we have created a _hello_world.py_ file containing the following:

```
print("Hello world")

```

You can run it by executing the following command (the _hello_world.py_ file must be in your current working terminal directory):

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  print("Hello world")
```

::

## 2.2 IPython Basics

In this section, I will quickly introduce you to the IPython shell and Jupyter notebooks, and introduce some basic concepts.

### Running IPython Shell

You can start the IPython shell in the terminal just like starting a regular Python interpreter, using the `ipython` command:

```
$ ipython
Python 3.10.4 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Mar 24 2022, 17:38:57)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.31.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: a = 5

In [2]: a
Out[2]: 5

```

You can execute any Python statement by typing the Python statement and pressing Enter (or Enter key). When you only input a variable, IPython will present the object's string representation:

```
In [5]: import numpy as np

In [6]: data = [np.random.standard_normal() for i in range(7)]

In [7]: data
Out[7]:
[-0.20470765948471295,
 0.47894333805754824,
 -0.5194387150567381,
 -0.55573030434749,
 1.9657805725027142,
 1.3934058329729904,
 0.09290787674371767]

```

The first two lines are Python code statements; the second statement creates a variable named `data` pointing to a newly created list. The last line prints the value of `data` to the console.

Many kinds of Python objects are formatted for readability or _pretty printing_, which is different from normal printing using `print`. If you print the above `data` variable in a standard Python interpreter, it will be less readable:

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> data = [np.random.standard_normal() for i in range(7)]
>>> print(data)
>>> data
[-0.5767699931966723, -0.1010317773535111, -1.7841005313329152,
-1.524392126408841, 0.22191374220117385, -1.9835710588082562,
-1.6081963964963528]

```

### 2.3 Running Jupyter Notebook in the Terminal

One of the main components of the Jupyter project is the _notebook_, an interactive document for code, text (including Markdown), data visualizations, and other outputs. Jupyter notebooks interact with _kernels_, which are implementations of the Jupyter interactive computing protocol for different programming languages. The Python Jupyter kernel uses the IPython system as its underlying behavior.

To start Jupyter, run the `jupyter` `notebook` command in the terminal:

```
$ jupyter notebook
[I 15:20:52.739 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory:
/home/wesm/code/pydata-book
[I 15:20:52.739 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 15:20:52.739 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4bb443a63f2d...
[I 15:20:52.740 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down
all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
Created new window in existing browser session.
    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/wesm/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-185259-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4...
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4...

```

On many platforms, Jupyter will automatically open in your default web browser (unless you start with `--no-browser`). Otherwise, you can navigate to the HTTP address printed when you started the notebook, such as `http://localhost:8888/?token=0a77b52fefe52ab83e3c35dff8de121e4bb443a63f2d3055`

![Jupyter Notebook Homepage](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/200aaf1140ee7ca4bfeea2d34e01bec7.png)

To create a new notebook, click the "New" button and select the "Python 3" option. As shown in the figure above. If this is your first time trying it, try clicking on the empty "cell" and entering a single line of Python code. Then press Shift-Enter to execute it.

### Built-in Search

Using the question mark (`?`) before or after a variable will display some general information about the object:

```
In [1]: b = [1, 2, 3]

In [2]: b?
Type:        list
String form: [1, 2, 3]
Length:      3
Docstring:
Built-in mutable sequence.

If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
The argument must be an iterable if specified.

In [3]: print?
Docstring:
print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
Optional keyword arguments:
file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
Type:      builtin_function_or_method

```

This is called _object introspection_. If the object is a function or instance method, it will also display if a docstring is defined. Suppose we wrote the following function (you can reproduce it in IPython or Jupyter):

```
def add_numbers(a, b):
 """
 Add two numbers together

 Returns
 -------
 the_sum : type of arguments
 """
 return a + b

```

Then use ? to display the docstring:

```
In [6]: add_numbers?
Signature: add_numbers(a, b)
Docstring:
Add two numbers together
Returns
-------
the_sum : type of arguments
File:      <ipython-input-9-6a548a216e27>
Type:      function

```

## 2.3 Python Language Basics

### Installing Python Libraries in Pyodide

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
    import pyodide_js
    await pyodide_js.loadPackage("micropip")

    import micropip
    await micropip.install("numpy")
```

::

### Indentation

Python uses spaces to represent indentation to structure your code. Especially in `define` or `for loop` statements,

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

````python
  import micropip
  await micropip.install('numpy')

  import numpy as np
  # Create NumPy array
  array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  # Choose pivot
  pivot = 3
  # Create two lists to store elements less than pivot and greater than or equal to pivot
  less = []
  greater = []

  for x in array:
    if x < pivot:
      less.append(x)
    else:
      greater.append(x)
  print("Elements less than pivot:", less)
  print("Elements greater than or equal to pivot:", greater)
::


Colon (`:`) indicates the start of a code block, and all code within the block must be indented by the same amount until the block ends. Four spaces are generally used as the default indentation. You will find that when you type `:` and press Enter, Jupyter will automatically indent for you.

### Comments

Any text preceded by a hash (`#`) will be ignored by the Python interpreter. This is often used to add comments to the code. Sometimes you may also want to exclude certain code blocks without deleting them. One solution is to *comment out* the code:
The second method is to use `"""` or `'''` to comment multiple lines of code.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}
  ```python
  # This is a simple calculator function
  def calculator(a, b, operation):
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations.

    Parameters:
    a (float): The first number
    b (float): The second number
    operation (str): Type of operation ('+', '-', '*', '/')

    Returns:
    float: The result of the calculation
    """
    if operation == '+':
        return a + b
    elif operation == '-':
        return a - b
    elif operation == '*':
        return a * b
    elif operation == '/':
        # TODO: Add error handling for division by zero
        return a / b
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported operation")

  # Test the calculator function
  print(calculator(5, 3, '+'))  # Should output 8
  print(calculator(10, 2, '*'))  # Should output 20

  # print(calculator(10, 0, '/'))  # This line would cause an error, temporarily commented out
````

::

This will skip the commented parts and run the code below. Comments are very useful and a good habit, both to help you review later and to make it easier for others to understand your code.

### Variables and Parameter Passing

In Python, we use `=` to create variables and assign values, as follows:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  a
```

::

Here, variable `a` is an integer list, and suppose we assign `a` to a new variable `b`:

In Python, `a` and `b` now point to the same object, which is the original list `[1, 2, 3]`. You can prove this by appending an element to `a` and then checking `b`:

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  b = a
  a.append(4)
  print("a =", a)
  print("b =", b)
```

::

Tips: We generally use English words or letters to name variables, and cannot use numbers, or some keywords and function names like `if, while, print, def` etc.

::code-mirror-run{:editable="true" maxHeight="20rem" :showInCol="true"}

```python
  # Incorrect example
  print = 5  # Attempting to use the built-in function 'print' as a variable name

  # This will raise a TypeError at runtime
  print("Hello, World!")  # This line of code will cause an error
```

::

### Binary Operators

| Operation     | Description                                                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a + b         | Add a and b                                                                   |
| a - b         | Subtract b from a                                                             |
| a\* b         | Multiply a by b                                                               |
| a / b         | Divide a by b                                                                 |
| a // b        | Floor division by b, removing any decimal remainder                           |
| a\*\* b       | Raise a to the power of b                                                     |
| a & b         | True if both a and b are True; for integers, bitwise AND                      |
| a ^ b         | For booleans, True if a or b is True, but not both; for integers, bitwise XOR |
| a == b        | True if a equals b                                                            |
| a != b        | True if a is not equal to b                                                   |
| a < b, a <= b | True if a is less than (less than or equal to) b                              |
| a > b, a >= b | True if a is greater than (greater than or equal to) b                        |
| a is b        | True if a and b refer to the same Python object                               |
| a is not b    | True if a and b refer to different Python objects                             |

The table above shows some simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparisons, etc., which are often used in logical judgments.

### Data Types

In Python, there are the following data types:

- Integer (int)
- Float (float)
- String (str)
- Boolean (bool)
- List (list)
- Tuple (tuple)
- Dictionary (dict)
- Set (set)
- Date and Time (datetime)

#### Dictionary

### 字典 (Dictionary)

字典是 Python 中另一个重要的数据类型，它允许我们存储键值对（key-value pairs）。字典使用花括号 `{}` 来定义，每个键值对用冒号 `:` 分隔，不同键值对之间用逗号 `,` 分隔。

让我们通过一个实际的例子来理解字典：

假设我们要记录一个学生的基本信息：

```
student = {
    "name": "张三",
    "age": 20,
    "grades": [85, 92, 78],
    "is_active": True
}

```

这个例子展示了字典的几个重要特点：

- 键(key)必须是唯一的
- 值(value)可以是任何数据类型（字符串、数字、列表、布尔值等）
- 字典是可变的，我们可以添加、修改或删除键值对

#### 常用字典操作

```python
# 访问值
print(student["name"])  # 输出: 张三

# 修改值
student["age"] = 21

# 添加新的键值对
student["class"] = "Python班"

# 删除键值对
del student["is_active"]

# 获取所有键
print(student.keys())

# 获取所有值
print(student.values())
```

> 💡 **实际应用案例**
> 在实际开发中，字典经常用于处理配置信息、API 响应数据或数据库查询结果。例如，一个电商系统中的商品信息可以用字典表示：

```python
product = {
    "id": "P001",
    "name": "机械键盘",
    "price": 299.99,
    "stock": 50,
    "specifications": {
        "brand": "Cherry",
        "type": "机械轴",
        "color": "黑色"
    }
}
```

这个内容参考了 PPT 中"Python 基础数据类型"章节中的字典示例，特别是关于学生信息管理的案例。我建议在讲解时，可以让学生动手实践这些操作，加深对字典概念的理解。

你觉得这样的内容编排如何？我可以根据你的反馈进行调整。
